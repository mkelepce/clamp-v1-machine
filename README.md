There are many vulnerabilities on the CLAMP machine.

You need some time and patience when dealing with security vulnerabilities. The scenario is progressing through web vulnerabilities. You will feel the test air while doing them. Maybe you'il have some fun.

When sending information, the security of the protocol you use is very important. You must keep the evidence in safe places.

Good Luck!
